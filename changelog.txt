VERSION 1.07
01/17/2025
1. Incomplete Function Content Error
- The code is truncated at the end of ssll_login_logo_url_title(). We're missing:
- The rest of the function body
- The activation hook implementation
- The deactivation hook implementation
- The uninstall hook implementation

2. Missing Function Check: In the security headers function is_login() is not a WordPress core function.

3. File Operation Security Issue: Direct usage of file_put_contents() in ssll_create_js_file() should use WordPress filesystem API instead.

4. Missing Permission Check: ssll_serve_logo() doesn't verify user permissions before serving the logo.

5. Incomplete Error Handling readfile() in ssll_serve_logo() lacks error handling.

6. Domain Validation Logic Error: In ssll_validate_image_url(), the domain validation might fail for root domain (non-www) installations.

7. Missing Hook Priority: Security headers should have an early priority.
